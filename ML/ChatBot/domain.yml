  utter_time_to_visit:
  - text: "The best time to visit Egypt is during winter from October to April,when temperatures are lower.
           The most popular time for tourist is December and January.
           Tourism in Egypt is booming this time of the year so make sure you plan in advance.
           March, April, and September are also good months to travel to Egypt if you plan to avoid the crowd.
           The daytime weather can be quite pleasant and its the best time to enjoy water activities such as snorkeling, scuba diving and swimming."

  utter_temperature_in_egypt:
  - text: "Egypt’s climate is dry, hot, and dominated by desert.
           It has a mild winter season with rain falling along coastal areas, and a hot and dry summer season (May to September).
           Daytime temperatures vary by season and change with the prevailing winds.
           In the coastal regions, temperatures range between average winter minimums of 14°C (November to April) and average summer maximums of 30°C (May to October).
           Temperatures vary widely in the inland desert areas, especially during the summer, where they range from 7°C at night to 43°C during the day.
           During winter, temperatures in the desert fluctuate less dramatically, but can reach 0°C at night and as high as 18°C during the day.
           Egypt also experiences hot wind storms, known as “khamsin”, which carry sand and dust and sweep across the northern coast of Africa.
           These khamsin storms typically occur between March and May and can increase the temperature by 20°C in two hours; and can last for several days."

          January
              7 January – Coptic Orthodox Christmas
                An estimated 10–15 per cent of Egypt’s population are Christian, and the vast majority practise Coptic Orthodox Christianity.
                While it's still a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, Coptic Christmas follows the Julian calendar instead of the Gregorian calendar that places Christmas in December.
                It's preceded by an epic 43-day fast, meaning people are primed for a feast.
           February
              22 February – Abu Simbel Sun Festival
                Abu Simbel is one of the premier antiquities in all of Egypt, and twice a year (this festival is also held on 22 October) you can see the sun god statues of the inner sanctuary, normally shrouded in darkness, illuminated by a beam of sunlight.
                Locals celebrate with traditional Nubian dance, street food (save stomach space for some fresh koshari) and live music outside the temple.

            April
                Coptic Orthodox Easter
                  Like Coptic Christmas, Coptic Easter is preceded by a long fast – in this case a 55-day one.
                  As a result, a vigil on Coptic Easter eve ends with incredible feast that continues into the next day.
                  Dates change every year.

                Sham Ennessim
                  The day after Coptic Easter, Christians and non-Christians alike take to Egypt’s parks and gardens to celebrate the beginning of spring on the national public holiday Sham Ennessim.
                  Date changes every year.

            June
                Ramadan
                  This Islamic holy month of daytime fasting (and evening feasting) is observed throughout Egypt.
                  If you travel during this period, the dates of which change every year, you’ll find locals more subdued and streets quiet during the daytime when folks are fasting.
                  It’s also possible that some historical sites will operate on limited hours.
                  Travellers are not expected to observe the fast, but drinking, smoking and scoffing down street food in public during the daylight hours is frowned upon.
                  Whether or not you enjoy travelling in Egypt during Ramadan will depend on your reasons for travel.
                  If you’re interested in local customs and traditions, then you may find it enriching.
                  If you would rather be able to see things as quickly and efficiently as possible, this may not be the best month for you to travel to Egypt.

                Sandbox Music Festival
                  For three days in June (dates change annually), Egypt’s young and hip descend on El Gouna for an outdoor music festival that takes place right on the beach. House, techno and dance music DJs draw revellers that party well into the night.
                  Travellers who want to immerse themselves in young and contemporary Egyptian culture (or just love dancing) will get a kick out of this beachside fest.

            August
                Eid al-Adha
                  This four-day Islamic celebration (dates change annually) commemorates the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son in quite a literal way – the ceremonial slaughter of a goat or sheep by those who can afford it.
                  This is followed by a few days of feasting and partying among friends and family. If you travel during this period, you’ll likely be invited to share in the meals and festivities with locals you meet along the way.

                El Hijra (Islamic New Year)
                  Recently made a public holiday, El Hijra is celebrated by members of the Muslim Sufi sect in a relatively solemn way (at least compared to other holidays). There isn’t any great benefit to being in the country for Islamic New Year, but it won’t disrupt your plans much either. Dates change each year.

            September
                  September 11 or 12 – Coptic Orthodox New Year
                    Celebrated on either September 11 or September 12 (depending on whether there’s a leap year coming up) Coptic New Year is a celebration of martyrs. There’s feasting, of course, but nothing like the mass celebrations that occur on other Coptic holidays.

            October
                  22 October – Abu Simbel Sun Festival
                    Abu Simbel is one of the premier antiquities in all of Egypt, and twice a year (this festival is also held on 22 February) you can see the sun god statues of the inner sanctuary, normally shrouded in darkness, illuminated by a beam of sunlight.
                    Locals celebrate with traditional Nubian dances being performed, street food everywhere (save stomach space for some fresh koshari) and live music outside the temple.

            November
                  Mild un Nabi
                    This nationally recognised public holiday is held in celebration of the birth of the Prophet Mohammed."
